- `products`: Main product catalog.
- `product_variants` & `product_prices`: SKU and pricing management.
- `orders` & `order_items`: specific transactional data.
- `profiles`: User profile extensions.
- `cart` custom logic (often client-side or separate table depending on implementation).
- `notifications`, `coupons`, `wishlists`, `posts` (blog).

Check `src/types/database.types.ts` for the full type definitions.
